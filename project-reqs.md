# NLP1 17-18 Project Report 

The report describes your project, the work that you have done and your findings. The report should
be structured like a research paper. 

## Template
You are required to use an official template that is also used in research for the NAACL conference. You can download it from http://naacl2018.org/call_for_paper.html or directly edit it on Overleaf: https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/instructions-for-naacl-hlt-2018-proceedings/mbgbzpzxdkth 

## Length
Your report can be at most 8 pages long, excluding references. 

## Structure of report
For the report, we suggest that use the following structure:

- Title, members of the group, student ids
- Abstract (1 paragraph: the main idea and a key finding)
- Introduction (max 2 pages):
	- Description of the problem area and the problem itself
	- What is the research question / goal?
	- Why is this an important / meaningful / interesting problem to consider?
	-  The very basic idea of the approach and why this is a reasonable approach for this problem?
- Problem: (roughly 1-2 pages)
	- Explain the problem; what kind of assumptions / observations you have about the problem
- Approach (roughly 2-3 pages)
	- Explain the model; if any important assumptions are made at this stage, explain why they are
reasonable or necessary
	- Explain learning / inference algorithms
	- Explaining (perhaps briefly) any necessary preprocessing / postprocesing / data acquisition stages
(maybe earlier, depending on the project; may also move to the experimental section)
- Experiments / Empirical evaluation (roughly 2-3 pages)
	- Any details about experiments (dataset sizes, parameter selection, etc)
	- Results
	- Analysis (discussion of results / visualization / findings / etc)
- Discussion and Conclusions (0.5 – 1 page)
	- Refer to the research questions you defined in your introduction.
	- Any related work you are aware of?
	- Challenges you observed?
	- “Future work” (you do not need to do this work really J, but what would you change in the
model / what experiments you would run / etc, if you would have a chance to do this? What other
people should look into?
	- Any thoughts / observation / wider implications
- Team responsibilities (1 paragraph)
  - Who did what


Write this report in such a way that it should be understandable to any student who took this class. 
In this class, we are not aiming for a very broad audience – this should be a paper accessible to a 
not-very-experience researcher in natural language processing or machine learning. 
However, make sure that the report describes interesting finding and your methods, 
rather than provides a detailed description of your program.

- Do give a clear description on the decisions you made in the design
- Use scientific writing style and language in your report (formal, clear, concise)
- Use figures and tables to clearly display your results
- Try to make the report interesting (i.e. concentrate on insights / general ideas / findings / etc – rather than on obvious details)
